The app is deployed at https://delivery.mulhollandbot.com/

1. To run the app, first install the necessary `node_modules` for React. Then, execute the command `docker-compose up` to start the backend part.

2. `npm run dev` to start react app.

3. If you don't have Docker, ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your system and that a database named "delivery" has been created with the username `postgres` and the password `1111`. Next, navigate to the `delivery-nest` directory and run the command `npm run start`.
